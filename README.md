# Vanilla Jsonp angular-seed

A tiny lib to fetch remote data via the jsonp protocol

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
grunt
```

Now you can run the tests at `http://127.0.0.1:4141/tests/tests.html`.
